## 🧠 A Bit About Me

Hey! I'm Tommy Nguyen—an Associate Software Engineer at **SS&C Eze**, where I work on feature development, workflow optimization, and good old-fashioned bug hunting for our OMS product.

I hold both a **Bachelor’s** and a **Master’s** degree in Computer Science from **Wentworth Institute of Technology**, with a specialization in **AI/ML** during my grad years. During that time, I published several papers and worked on a variety of research projects (shoutout to Professor Ergezer 🥳).

I'm passionate about AI, finance, game development, mathematics, and just about anything that sparks curiosity. If it's shiny and challenging—count me in!

## 🧰 Tech Stack
Here are a few of my most commonly used technologies (some, but most definitely not all)!

**Languages:** Python, C#, Java, SQL, JavaScript  
**Frameworks & Libraries:** .NET, Numpy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, FastAPI

**Tools:** Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions, VS Code, Unity, Jupyter, Docker  
**Databases:** SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL

## 🗂️ Featured Projects
The projects below are housed in private repositories, but if you're curious to see them in action, feel free to reach out—I'd be happy to set up a quick demo!

- **🕹️ Zone Zero**  
  A first-person horror stealth game where players must explore a maze, uncover hidden notes, and avoid a lurking, terrifying monster.

- **📈 Watcher**  
  A stock monitoring, analysis, and report generation platform that provides short- and long-term forecasts, sentiment analysis on company news, and stock recommendations (buy, hold, or sell).

  [Here's one example report generated by Watcher!](pdfs/watcher_example.pdf)

- **🤖 Personal Assistant Sebastian (2025)**  
  A fully end-to-end smart assistant using VAD, TTS, and SadTalker. Currently under development—real-time animation is tricky, but I'm working on optimizing it!  
  👉 [Follow the progress on GitHub](https://github.com/Tommy-Nguyen-cpu/SadTalker-CUDA-Optimized)

## 😄 Fun Facts

- 🐭 I once modeled an entire monster for a game using **just a laptop trackpad**... it was painful.
- 🧠 I love digging deep into how AI works—from classical to generative—which is why I’m revisiting a lot of math (and because I’m a math nerd 🤣).
- 💡 My dream project? Building a fully functional Iron Man suit powered by my assistant, Sebastian. It’s a long shot—but hey, if you’re going to dream, dream big, right?
- 🛌 Outside of code and AI, I love writing stories, cooking, working out, and… sleeping. Lots of sleeping.
