## 🧠 A Bit About Me

Hey! I'm Tommy Nguyen—an Associate Software Engineer at **SS&C Eze**, where I work on feature development, workflow optimization, and good old-fashioned bug hunting for our OMS product.

I hold both a **Bachelor’s** and a **Master’s** degree in Computer Science from **Wentworth Institute of Technology**, with a specialization in **AI/ML** during my grad years. During that time, I published several papers and worked on a variety of research projects (shoutout to Professor Ergezer 🥳).

I'm passionate about AI, finance, game development, mathematics, and just about anything that sparks curiosity. If it's new, shiny, and challenging—count me in!

## 😄 Fun Facts

- 🐭 I once modeled an entire monster for a game using **just a laptop trackpad**... it was painful.
- 🧠 I love digging deep into how AI works—from classical to generative—which is why I’m revisiting a lot of math (and because I’m a math nerd XD).
- 💡 My dream project? A real working Iron Man suit powered by my Sebastian assistant.
- 🛌 Outside of code and AI, I love writing stories, cooking, working out, and… sleeping. Lots of sleeping.
